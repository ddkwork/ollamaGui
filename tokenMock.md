**Generic type constraints** allow you to specify constraints on a type that can vary depending on the specific type being instantiated.

**Syntax:**

```go
type Name[T any] string
```

**Parameters:**

* `T`: The type variable. It can be any type, including primitive types, structures, and functions.

**Examples:**

* Integer constraint:**
```go
type Age[T int] int
```

This constraint ensures that `T` is an integer type.

* String constraint:**
```go
type Name[T string]
```

This constraint ensures that `T` is a string type.

* Struct constraint:**
```go
type User[T struct] {
Name string
Age  int
}
```

This constraint ensures that `T` is a struct type with at least two fields named `Name` and `Age`.

* Function constraint:**
```go
type Calculator[T any] func(T, T) T
```

This constraint ensures that `T` is a type that implements the `Calculator` interface.

**Benefits of using generic type constraints:**

* Code reusability:** You can apply the same constraint to multiple types, reducing code duplication.
* Type safety:** Constraints ensure that only valid types are used, preventing runtime errors.
* Improved maintainability:** By separating the constraint from the type, it becomes easier to understand and modify.

**Note:**

* Generic type constraints are not applicable to primitive types (e.g., `int`, `string`).
* Constraints can be applied to function types only if the function is generic.
* Constraints can be used with type parameters, allowing you to specify different constraints for different types.
